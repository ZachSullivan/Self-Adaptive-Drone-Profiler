    1. Start by computing an inital population. This would presumably be a population of randomized arguments for each behavior in the BT.
    ... such as, randomized take off velocities, randomized breaking velocity, TODO: Need to identify exactly what arguments would be randomized.
    2. Establish a while loop that continually iterates until a termination condition is reached, this ends the GA
    2.1 Generate scores for each indiviual in the population of params
    2.2 select which scored individuals within the current popualation should be repopulated.
    2.3 Produce offspring from the selected individuals by crossing over
    2.4 Select with a given probability a selection of offspring and mutate
    2.5 repeat the loop
    3. Once loop termination logic is reached, return the best fit individual
